# Avanor does not support Internet Explorer nor Edge â€¦ yet

Avanor is really fresh, and haven't had a chance to get everything in working order. Unfortunately, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge are not available during development, due to it being made on free time using personal gear, none of which have Microsoft Windows installed. This have caused there to be a number of bugs on the aforementioned web browsers that are currently unfeasible to resolve in near time.

To use Avanor, switch to another browser. You can also wait and come back later. Much, much later, when support for Microsoft web browsers are fixed.

## Supported browsers

These are the platforms that Avanor is tested on, since it is what is installed on devices used for development or on devices in close proximity to development devices.

### Google Chrome

### Mozilla Firefox

### Apple iOS browsers

Avanor should work on any browser on iOS.

## Browsers suspected to work

### Various Android browsers

Every person who have an Android gets asked if they can check Avanor an see if they spot any problems.

### Apple Safari

It is just assumed that Avanor works on Safari.
